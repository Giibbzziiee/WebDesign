## Reflection

I really enjoyed using both Flexbox and Grid because they make structuring a page way easier than manually positioning everything.
Flexbox helps me quickly organize content in a single direction, while Grid gives me more control over laying out larger sections of a page.
Together, they streamline my workflow by reducing the amount of trial and error I usually deal with when aligning elements.
So far, I think I prefer Flexbox because it feels more intuitive and works great for most of the components I build, but I’m starting to appreciate Grid more as the layouts get more complex.
