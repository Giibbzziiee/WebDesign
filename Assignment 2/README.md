# I don't know what to put in here. Reflections right? September 21st, 2025 (Do you remember? *wink*)
## I suppose the best way to reflect on this week is to acknowledge the stuff I learned hahaha. I went a bit outside of
## what we were supposed to do and learned about flex boxes as well as the new tags such as nav, footer, div, and header.
## I actually had a lot of fun this week because I finally figured out how to get things like text boxes to start going where I want them
## on my page rather than just being wherever they can find space for themselves. I'm learning something every time I start tackling
## these assignments and that's probably the most important thing about it to me. I just want to be knowledgeable on the topic for the future.
