<h1>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F***</h1>

<h2>A Book by Mark Manson</h2>

<h3>What's it about?</h3>
<p>Learning the subtleties of when you should give a f*** and when you really really shouldn't. Not only that but also about knowing how to know whats worth giving a f*** about.</p>

<h3>Why did I read it?</h3>
<p>Truth be told I found the title to be pretty funny and it drew me in. I didn't realize that I was in for such an interesting ride but it's really helped me open my eyes about a few different topics in life</p>

<h3>Do I recommend it?</h3>
<p> Hell yeah I do! It's a fantastic read. I've never been big on lifestyle books in my past but this read a bit differently in my mind. I highly recommend.</p>
