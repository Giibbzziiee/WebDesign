<h1>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F***</h1>

<h2>A Book by Mark Manson</h2>

<h3>Ch. 3: You Are Not Special</h3>
<p>This chapter is about challenging the cultural obsessions with always being "extraordinary". Not only that but that our ordinariness frees us to focus on whats truly important and meaningful.</p>

<h3>Ch. 5: You Are Always Choosing</h3>
<p>It's about how life is made up of choices, and we are responsible for how we respond to our circumstances, even if its something that isn't our fault. Learning that blame and responsibility are not the same.</p>

<h3>Ch. 8: The Importance of Saying No</h3>
<p>In this chapter, Manson emphasizes that real happiness and meaning come from commitment, not from keeping endless options open. That goes for people, values, and causes.
Learning to say no allows us to focus deeply on what we truly value. Commitment takes sacrifice, but it also creates stability and stronger relationships.

<h4>Comments</h4>
<p class="left"> "Hi Ethan! I love the colors you chose for the backgrounds, contrasting
<br> colors always go great, I'm sure there was a lot to choose from. 
<br> Your formatting is also clean and easy to read. Love
<br> the book choice too. Awesome Work!" - Laurel Schmidt</p>

<p class="right"> "Great book choice! I've only read a few chapters so far -
<br>on long flights. Although you didn't give much though to 
<br>the color scheme, as mentioned, I think the colors
<br>you picked make a really interesting contrast you don't
<br>see everyday and it successfully grabs the attention of the
<br>viewer right away. Nice spacing. Probably a good design
<br>choice to bleep the word in the title lol." - Austin Parson
