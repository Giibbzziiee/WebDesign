# Reflection
## What is something new you learned while building your site?

The biggest thing I learned while building my site is how everything we practiced throughout the semester fits together once you are working on a real project. Flexbox and Grid used to feel like completely separate tools, but when I started building the gallery, the blog previews, and the hero layout, it all started to make sense in a way it did not before. I also finally understood why semantic HTML matters instead of just using a bunch of divs everywhere (even though I still have a habit of doing that). On top of that, getting comfortable with organizing folders, linking scripts and styles correctly, and making sure everything works on GitHub Pages made the whole project feel much more professional. It was cool seeing the site running pretty close to exactly how I imagined it.

## What are you most proud of in your final project?

I am proud of how much personality I was able to bring into this site. The Food from E Bay theme, the blog previews, the gallery layout, the canvas animation, the popup, and the parallax element all help the site feel like something I would actually show people rather than just another class assignment. Throughout the semester we kept building different components like responsive grids, carousels, navbars, and layouts, and this project gave me the chance to bring all of them into one place. It feels cohesive in a way that reflects everything we learned and also matches my own style.

## What would you add or refine in the future?

If I had more time, I would focus on polishing the visual side of the site even more. I would tighten up the typography, improve spacing, and smooth out some of the animations so the whole design feels more unified. I would also expand the blog section and make the gallery easier to update without editing the HTML every time. Now that I understand the full process of building a site from structure to styling to responsiveness to JavaScript interaction and deployment, I feel more confident about creating something even bigger or turning parts of this project into a real portfolio piece later on.
