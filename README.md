<h1>Markdown Reflections for 9/14/25</h1>
<p>I decided to fully incorporate both of the pieces of feedback that I had received as there wasn't much in the way of suggestions in them but rather just compliments. I took some time to add a few more classes to my style sheet so I could justify to the left and to the right. The big issue I ran into is that I don't quite know how make both of the comments look like they start on the same line of text.</p>
<p> I went this route because I thought that it would be fun to make the comments look like a critics response to an actual release of a book or something along those lines. Just to be kinda goofy with it.</p>
