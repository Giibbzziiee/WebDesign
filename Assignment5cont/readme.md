# Reflection
## How I'm Doing

I feel like I’m understanding how things are structured for the most part. The layout systems, component ideas, and organization patterns are all starting to make sense as I work through them. The hardest part for me right now is just remembering all the tags, attributes, and what each one does. That’s mostly on me—I need to keep taking notes, revisit the documentation more often, and keep applying everything so it sticks. The more I work with the code, the more natural it’s starting to feel.

## What Could Help Moving Forward

As we move into the final module, I think the biggest thing that would help is just keeping the same clarity you have been around when and why to use certain tags or layout approaches. Examples that break down “here’s the structure” and “here’s why it works like this” always help me connect the pieces and I feel that I've been able to understand this class a lot more clearly than other thanks to how you explain the topics. Otherwise, I feel good about where I’m at and I’m ready to wrap everything together in this last stretch.
